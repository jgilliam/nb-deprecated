Dear <%= @user.name %>,

You've shown a concern for health care at White House 2, so I wanted to alert you to an opportunity to have your voice heard by President Obama's administration.  

They just set up an online forum at change.gov (with public comments and voting!) asking for your thoughts on what most worries you about healthcare in our country.  Please go spread your ideas.

Here's the link: http://change.gov/page/content/discusshealthcare

Thanks for being involved.  Oh, and I learned something interesting today on the site: 52% of you who endorse a single-payer healthcare system also endorse Obama's non-single-payer plan, "enact quality, affordable healthcare for all."
