= websolr-rails gem

This gem provides Rails support for websolr.com, and a command-line tool to interact with 
the indexes hosted there.  The Rails support is reverse-compatible with acts_as_solr.

== RDoc

Ruby documentation is at http://onemorecloud.github.com/websolr-rails

== Current Release

There is no numbered release yet, but the master branch is always considered stable.

== Support

For now, please send email to support@onemorecloud.com

== Changes

Please refer to the CHANGELOG[http://github.com/mattmatt/acts_as_solr/blob/master/CHANGE_LOG]

== Installation

$: gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
$: sudo gem install onemorecloud-websolr-rails

== Configuration

$: export WEBSOLR_USER=my_username
$: export WEBSOLR_PWD=my_password
$: cd my_rails_project
$: websolr add -n my_index_name
$: websolr configure -e development -n my_index_name

== Basic Usage

# Just include the line below to any of your ActiveRecord models:
  acts_as_solr

# Or if you want, you can specify only the fields that should be indexed:
  acts_as_solr :fields => [:name, :author]

# Then to find instances of your model, just do:
  Model.find_by_solr(query) #query is a string representing your query

# Please see ActsAsSolr::ActsMethods for a complete info

== acts_as_solr in your tests

If you would like to mock out Solr calls so that a Solr server is not needed (and your tests will run much faster), just add this to your `test_helper.rb` or similar:

    class ActsAsSolr::Post
      def self.execute(request)
        true
      end
    end
