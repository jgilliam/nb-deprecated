= websolr-rails

This overrides acts_as_solr or Sunspot to use the value of the 
environment variable WEBSOLR_URL as the Solr Search server, 
provided that it's defined.

After installing the gem, you can include websolr-rails in your 
app by either starting the webapp like:

  WEBSOLR_URL=http://index.websolr.com/solr/<api-key> ./script/server
  
Or, you can put the following in /environment/production.rb, or an
initializer, etc:

  # production.rb
  ENV["WEBSOLR_URL"] = "http://index.websolr.com/solr/<api-key>"

  # WEBSOLR_URL must already be defined.
  require "websolr-rails"
